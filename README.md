# Power BI Project-Superstore Sales

## Overview

Visualizing the sales data of a superstore using Power BI. The dataset contains 18 columns and 9800 rows.

## Business Task

To find the sales and revenue patterns to help the superstore optimize its operations

## Data Source

I obtained this dataset from Kaggle, and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

## Tool

Microsoft Power BI

## Process

Firstly, I created a vertical bar chart showing the number of purchases for every category of items. The data shows that customers mostly bought office supplies. When drilled down, I saw that binders were the items they bought the most.

* Although customers bought office supplies most frequently, I was not certain that it was the category that brought in the most revenue. Therefore, I created a pie chart to visualize revenue per category. The pie chart showed that while the revenue figures for each category are similar, Technology brings in the most revenue, and the highest grossing sub-category under Technology is Phones.

* After learning that phones brought in the most revenue in the Technology category, I wanted to find out what sub-category of items grossed the most overall, so I created a treemap. From the visual below, the answer was still Phones, closely followed by chairs, which is in the Furniture Category.

* The superstore has branches in different states in the US, and I wanted to know the breakdown of revenue by state and category. Therefore, I created a horizontal bar chart with this information, and I observed that California, New York, and Texas were the biggest revenue drivers. The revenue per category varies by state and has to be studied on a state-by-state basis.

* Lastly, I decided to track the revenue of each product category for all the years in the dataset by creating a line chart. Technology and Office Supplies followed a similar trend, revenue dipped in 2016, but rose after that. Meanwhile, Furniture revenue steadily rose every year but grossed less than Technology and Office Supplies in 2018.

* I created a dashboard displaying the relevant portions of the dataset so I can easily communicate my findings and present them to relevant stakeholders.
